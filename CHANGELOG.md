# CHANGELOG

## v0.0.10 -> v0.0.11

-   Figured out why the instance icons are not on the same line when the text is
    not truncated (and do something about it)
-   Figure out how to login using Microsoft accounts as the legacy and mojang
    ones (at least the ones I know the api for is not alive anymore)

# Reminders (to me)

-   Maybe add an optional thread handle to the instances to see if it's
    currently running or not so that it can be stopped by the gui
-   Add a case for the assets not being hashes on pre 1.6 versions
